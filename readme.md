# README


This app randomly selects a name (first and last) from a .csv file that hasn't been chosen before, then rewrites the .csv to note that that name has now been chosen. 

### How it works
Type 'node main' to run.

### Format of csv file

The CSV file needs to have three cells, fist name, last name and one that designates whether that name has been selected before ('TRUE' or 'FALSE'). If you include a header in the first row, it will be skipped.

Piss metal is the best.
